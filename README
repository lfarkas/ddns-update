GETTING STARTED

1. Put your zone's key file into /etc/ddns-update/
2. If you would like to change the default behaviour edit your configuration 
   file in /etc/ddns-update/ddns-update.conf
3. Enable the service with:
   systemctl enable ddns-update
   or
   chkconfig --add ddns-update
4. Start the service
   systemctl start ddns-update
   or
   service ddns-update start

RUNNING MODE OF DDNS-UPDATE

There are many working mode for different requirements.

1. Oneshot where you just would like to update once the dns. Simple run:
   /usr/bin/ddns-update

2. In daemon mode where you run it as a system service with systemd or 
   initscript like in the above "getting started" section.

3. From cron where you can run it in a regular inteval eg every 5 minutes.
   See in sample/ddns-update.cron

4. From dhclient or dhcpcd when an interface bring up.
   See in sample/dhclient-exit-hooks or sample/dhcpcd-eth0.exe


WORKING MODE of DDNS-UPDATE

You can confiure to detect the external interface of your network and register
it's IP address into the dns. Or detect any system interface's IP address and
register it into the dns. For external IP address discovery different command 
can be used for as an URL grabber. Different site can be used as IP discovery 
service. All other parameters like host, domain and name server name and TTL
values can be configured.
All of these configuration (with a few others) can be found in the main 
configuration file /etc/ddns-update/ddns-update.conf

It's designed to use with NetworkManager although can be used without it.


USING DDNS-UPDATE WITH cron
    
If you have not configured ddns-update to use daemon-mode, you'll need to
configure cron to force an update once a month so that the dns entry will
not become stale.
    
    ## configure cron to force an update twice a month
    cp sample/ddns-update.cron /etc/cron.d/ddns-update

    
USING DDNS-UPDATE WITH dhcpcd-1.3.17
    
If you are using dhcpcd-1.3.17 or thereabouts, you can easily update
your DynDNS entry automatically every time your lease is obtained
or renewed by creating an executable file named:
    /etc/dhcpc/dhcpcd-{your-interface}.exe
ie.:
    cp sample/dhcpcd-eth0.exe /etc/dhcpc/dhcpcd-{your-interface}.exe

Other DHCP clients may have another method of calling out to programs
for updating DNS entries.
  
Alternatively, you may just configure ddns-update to operate as a daemon
and monitor your ethernet interface.


USING DDNS-UPDATE WITH dhclient

If you are using the ISC DHCP client (dhclient), you can update
your DynDNS entry automatically every time your lease is obtained
or renewed by creating an executable file named:
    /etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks
ie.:
    cp sample/dhclient-exit-hooks /etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks
    
Alternatively, you may just configure ddns-update to operate as a daemon
and monitor your ethernet interface.
