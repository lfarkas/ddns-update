USAGE

1. Put your zone's key file into /etc/ddns-update/
2. Edit your configuration file in /etc/ddns-update/ddns-update.conf if 
   you would like to change the default behaviour.
3. Enable the service with:
   systemctl enable ddns-update
   or
   chkconfig --add ddns-update
4. Start the service
   systemctl start ddns-update
   or
   service ddns-update start


USING DDNS-UPDATE WITH cron
    
If you have not configured ddns-update to use daemon-mode, you'll need to
configure cron to force an update once a month so that the dns entry will
not become stale.
    
    ## configure cron to force an update twice a month
    cp sample/ddns-update.cron /etc/cron.d/ddns-update

USING DDNS-UPDATE WITH dhcpcd-1.3.17
    
If you are using dhcpcd-1.3.17 or thereabouts, you can easily update
your DynDNS entry automatically every time your lease is obtained
or renewed by creating an executable file named:
    /etc/dhcpc/dhcpcd-{your-interface}.exe
ie.:
    cp sample/dhcpcd-eth0.exe /etc/dhcpc/dhcpcd-{your-interface}.exe

Other DHCP clients may have another method of calling out to programs
for updating DNS entries.
  
Alternatively, you may just configure ddns-update to operate as a daemon
and monitor your ethernet interface.

USING DDNS-UPDATE WITH dhclient

If you are using the ISC DHCP client (dhclient), you can update
your DynDNS entry automatically every time your lease is obtained
or renewed by creating an executable file named:
    /etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks
ie.:
    cp sample/dhclient-exit-hooks /etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks
    
Alternatively, you may just configure ddns-update to operate as a daemon
and monitor your ethernet interface.
